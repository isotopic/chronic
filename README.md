# Notify
Dispatch OSX notifications from bash scripts.


Direct usage:

```sh
notify.sh "It's time to do that thing!"

```

### Notes
By default, Apple script notifications are automatically dismissed after some seconds.
In order to stay until you dismiss them manually, go to:
System Preferences > Notifications > Script Editor > Script Editor alert style: Alerts
